# Engine3D
3D Game Engine built with SFML, glew and OpenGL

### Premise
Gain reputation as you complete dungeons by travelling around a procedurally
generated world. Gaining reputation is like gaining experience. Villages and
NPC generate responses proportional to local reputation. Emphasis on
survival, and crafting.

### Goals
 - Generate terrain based on character position
 - Move along terrain endlessly

### TODO
#### Renderer Goals:
    Group objects by common meshes/shaders/textures/materials to minimize
    resource binding calls, in order to maximize GPU concurrency.
